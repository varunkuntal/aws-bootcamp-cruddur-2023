- Video starts with introduction to tracking the free tier usage and how to see where your AWS bill will be.
- Pricing varies according to the region where services were spun up.

- Under Free tier we can visualize usage of free tier services and the forecasted usages.
- Billing alert system is discussed and its management. It also provides an overview of the budget system.
- Threshold value is set to trigger alert.
- Cost allocation tags can help filter resources to separate them logically.
- It also mentions how amazon cost calculator takes 730 hours into account during estimation instead of 720 or 733 for a month.
